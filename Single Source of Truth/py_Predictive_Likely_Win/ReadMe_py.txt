#Description: Predictive, likelihood of winning a certain dollar amount randomly from possible prize
##How many would they need to buy before landing any combination of 3 total $50s or $100

###Source: Galvanize Statsistics Lecture
###CodeType: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
###Data: Categorical, continuous, nominal
###DataTypes: direct code
###Model: Likelihood of winning, predictive statistics, mean of simulations
###Math: predictive statistics, frequencies, likelihood, weighting probability
###Subject: gambling, marketing, sales, quant
###Transformations: functional dependency, mean of simulation
###Visualizations:N/A
###CodingNotes: Mean of simulation is pretty cool
###Library: numpy, itertools

##More Details:
###Most likely probability is the mean of simulations of random data
###Probability of $1 = 52%, probability of $100 = 0.1%, what is the probability of picking three
###Of the three, what are the liklihood of winning either $50 or $100
