#Description: Process Control Charts of Call Rate and Length on Hold using arbitrary thresholds and Optimization on phone operators for days and times
##Linear Algebra and Six Sigma come together to do analysis on .R Data types and use descriptive and prescriptive statistics when not optimizing operations

###CodeType: R (not MarkDown), R Workspace
###Data: Nominal, Continuous, Categorical, Boolian, Date/Time, Time Series
###DataTypes: CSV, API, R Workspace, R Data, .R
###Model: Linear Algebra, Six Sigma, Optimization Analysis 
###Math: Descriptive, Prescriptive, Six Sigma, Pivot Tables, Business Intelligence, Vectorization, Optimization, Sparce Matrix, Optimization of time linear regressively from sparse matrix. 
###Subject: Operations, Economics, Business Intelligence, Management
###Transformations: Vectorization, Sparse Matrix, New Column for day of the week mapped in touple with ordered numbers associated with the dates, date string to date variables, average call per hour of day, 
###Visualizations: Process Control Charts for days of month, week, hrs in day for both call length and number of calls  
###CodingNotes: 
###Library: lubricate, grid, ggplot2, queueing, lpsolve

##More Details:
###Could use some conditional formatting on some of these call hour per day of week per hour of day in a given month or week... 
###Probably best to use Power BI or Tableau for the BI images
###Processes are way out of control by what appears to be an arbitrary standard rather than a formal six sigma out of control process
###The processes were out of control regardless
###Linear Algebra on Sparse Matrix using linear regressive techniques for optimization of out of control process
