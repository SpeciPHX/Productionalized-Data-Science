a#Description: K Means with automated seading and visualization of K and Kmean score
##

###Source: Galvinize DSI
###CodeType: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
###Data: Continuous, Phylogenic, 
###DataTypes: Parameters plotted
###Model: kMeans, kMean score
###Math: kMeans, Cluster Analysis, k mean score, RSS vs K, Sihouette vs k
###Subject: Marketing, Sales, Business Intelligence, Science, Quant, Management, 
###Transformations: RSS vs K, Sihouette vs k, 
###Visualizations: kMeans Clusters with relavant distributions from clusters
###CodingNotes: There was no Dendrogram created for phylogenic purposes
###Library: matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, sklearn.datasets import make_blobs, sklearn.cluster import KMeans, sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score, helper import cluster_and_plot

##More Details:
###Two clusters has the highest kmean score, 4 clusters also seems obvious but 8 and 7 kind of create a greater distinction of subgenre
